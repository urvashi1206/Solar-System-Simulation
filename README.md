# Solar-System-Simulation
This is a simulation. For the development I have used Unity3D platform. This game has the following features: 
1. It is a basic simulation of a Solar System.
2. It displays the entire solar system having the sun and other planets and the moon.
3. I have implmented the basic graphics and audio for all the planets revolving and revoluting.
4. Also if any game object(planets, sun, moon) are clicked, the camera follws that particular game object only. 
5. The coding language used is C#, and the platform used is Visual Studio 2019.
